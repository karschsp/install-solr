# Install-Solr.sh

This is a simple script for installing Apache Solr v4.5.0 on Ubuntu Linux for use with Drupal.

## Prerequisites

This script makes several assumptions.

1. You have *sudo* access
2. You have some Java runtime installed (_sudo apt-get install default-jre_)
3. Uh, I think that's it.

## Installation

1. Clone this repo to your home folder (such as *~/install-solr*)
2. cd into the directory and run ./installsolr.sh
3. Wait.
4. Once installation is complete, visit http://localhost:8983/solr in your browser of choice.
